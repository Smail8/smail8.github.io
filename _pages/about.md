I am a research scientist in AI and Robotics. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/) in Paris. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en/), advised by [Dr. Rachid Alami](https://www.laas.fr/en/homepages/rachid/) and [Dr. Thierry Simeon](https://cv.hal.science/thierry-simeon). My doctoral research focused on developing deep learning methods for multi-robot task and motion planning, more specifically, how to allow multiple robot agents to plan, reason spatially, and collaborate to solve complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. This work led to several publications in conferences such as ICLR, ICRA, IROS and ECAI.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), where I specialized in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. I also worked on several projects in industry, including building multimodal deep learning systems for emotion recognition at Logitech and developing autonomous systems and planning pipelines at OCP Group.

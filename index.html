    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Smail Ait Bouhsain, a Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence with a passion for building intelligent systems that can learn, reason, and interact with the world.</p>

    <p></p>I recently obtained my Ph.D. at LAAS-CNRS (France) under the supervision of Dr. Thierry Siméon and Dr. Rachid Alami. During my Ph.D., I focused on learning geometric reasoning for single and multi-robot task and motion planning, a topic that blends planning algorithms with deep learning to push the limits of what robots can autonomously achieve. My work has been recognized by experts in the field and has led to multiple publications in top-tier AI and Robotics conferences like ICLR, ICRA, IROS, and ECAI.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, I earned my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Robotics and Microengineering from EPFL (Switzerland), where I developed strong foundations in machine learning, intelligent systems engineering as well as management of technology.</p>
